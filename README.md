## Who Is the The Greatest Batman?
For Nearly three and a half decades Hollywood has been reinventing the iconic comic book character for the big screen. Clearly, audiences are captivated by the Batman and they continue to be willing to go see a new vision for the caped crusader. Over the course of 10 movies, there have been six different actors and 5 different directors who have attempted to all out-do each other. So.. who did it best?
