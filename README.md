Who Is the The Greatest Batman?
For Nearly two and a half decades Hollywood has been reinventing the iconic comic book character for the big screen. Clearly, audiences are captivated by the Batman and they continue to be willing to pay to see a new vision for the masked crusader. Over the course of 10 movies, there have been six different actors and 5 different directors who have attempted to all out do each other. So.. who did it best?

Using Data from IMDB.com my analysis will will take a look at the rating and the amount of money each film has generated. Additionally, I will be using data from the Academy Awards website in order to take a look at the accolades for the actors directors of each Batman movie. I will be looking to answer some of the following questions

Which stand alone batman movie has the highest rating?
Which recurring batman actor has the highest average rating?
Which batman Has the highest gross, net, and opening weekend?

Which actor & director has the most Oscars?
Did these actors and directors win their accolades before or after they made a batman movie?
Did, any of the actors or directors win for their version of batman?

by comparing the rating scores, amount of money generated, and number of awards that each batman actor and director brings to the table for their movies, i will be able to determine once and for all.. who is the best Batman?
